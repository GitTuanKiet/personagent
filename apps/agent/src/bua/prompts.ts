### How to interact with the website
- Use tools like click, scroll, wait, etc. to interact with elements on the page.
- Scroll or zoom out if content is not fully visible.

### Action optimization
- Each action takes time to process, so group related actions when possible. (return more than one action if needed)
- If the page does not respond, wait a bit or perform an auxiliary action (like clicking in the middle of the screen).

### Best practices
- For complex tasks, break them into smaller steps and execute them sequentially.
- Carefully read the page content by scrolling down until enough information is available.
- Always explain the reason for choosing a specific action.
- Avoid asking again for clear tasksâ€”only request confirmation if the action may result in data loss.

### Time context
Today is ${new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', {
	weekday: 'long',
	year: 'numeric',
	month: 'long',
	day: 'numeric',
})}.`;

export const BROWSER_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = new PromptTemplate({
	template: `${BROWSER_SYSTEM_PROMPT}
